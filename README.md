# 00 Statistical Learning

This is the first GitHub repo to familiarize you with the class.
Each of the subsequent modules will have a similar structure to this one.
Please ensure your repositories are always clean for your future employment opportunity.

As your participation, you are to customize each repository to match your preference.
This class can be done using languages like R or Python.
You can use RStudio, Jupyter, or other editors.
Therefore, there are unnecessary files in the repository that you need to get rid of.

First, You need to choose 
  - your language [R or Python] and 
  - you need to choose the format [Rmd or ipynb]

Based on your choice, you need to find the files that correspond to your choice and remove what is not necessary.

- Lab file from ISLR in Rmd or ipynb for R
  - Ch99-ISL[R|P]-[xxx]-lab.[Rmd|ipynb]
  
- In-class workbook
  - Ch99_[xxx]_[R|Python].[Rmd|Python]

- Additional materials
  - Data,
  - Images, etc

## Instruction

You are expected to go through the lab to get familiar with the coding.
Then, you are expected to complete the problems in class or as homework.

Since this is a practice module, you are not expected to complete this work.
However, I ask that you try it because it goes through the datasets used in the later exercises.

## Other program

If you strongly desire to do all of your homework in other languages, you may do so with the permission of the instructor.  In that case, please translate your files into the language of your choice.
You can find versions of Julia notes online, such as here:
https://github.com/tndoan/ISLR.jl

However, the in-class activity is prepared only for R and Python languages.  So, what you create will be used for future classes.  Please work with your instructor.
